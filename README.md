# CompSci 235 S2 2021: Sample COVID-19 Web Application

## Description

A Web application that demonstrates use of Python's Flask framework. The application makes use of libraries such as the Jinja templating library and WTForms. Architectural design patterns and principles including Repository, Dependency Inversion and Single Responsibility have been used to design the application. The application uses Flask Blueprints to maintain a separation of concerns between application functions. Testing includes unit and end-to-end testing using the pytest tool. 

## Branches

The main branch is the standard COVID web application, while the branch 'SQLite_Database_Repo' contains a version that integrates
the option to use an SQLite based database repository to provide a persistent storage mechanism. This introduces an additional dependency,
which is reflected in the requirements.txt file, the SQLAlchemy package.

To switch to the database branch, use the 'git checkout SQLite_Database_Repo' command after pulling in the latest version of the repository.

## Installation

**Installation via requirements.txt**

```shell
$ cd 2021CompSci235-03-CovidWebApp
$ py -3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When using PyCharm, set the virtual environment using 'File'->'Settings' and select 'Project:2021CompSci235-03-CovidWebApp' from the left menu. Select 'Project Interpreter', click on the gearwheel button and select 'Add'. Click the 'Existing environment' radio button to select the virtual environment. 

## Execution

**Running the application**

From the *2021CompSci235-03-CovidWebApp* directory, and within the activated virtual environment (see *venv\Scripts\activate* above):

````shell
$ flask run
```` 


## Configuration

The *2021CompSci235-03-CovidWebApp/.env* file contains variable settings. They are set with appropriate values.

* `FLASK_APP`: Entry point of the application (should always be `wsgi.py`).
* `FLASK_ENV`: The environment in which to run the application (either `development` or `production`).
* `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used to encrypt session data.
* `TESTING`: Set to False for running the application. Overridden and set to True automatically when testing the application.
* `WTF_CSRF_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used by the WTForm library.

These settings are for the database version of the code:

* `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: The URI of the SQlite database, by default it will be created in the root directory of the project.
* `SQLALCHEMY_ECHO`: If this flag is set to True, SQLAlchemy will print the SQL statements it uses internally to interact with the tables. 
* `REPOSITORY`: This flag allows us to easily switch between using the Memory repository or the SQLAlchemyDatabase repository.

## Testing

After you have configured pytest as the testing tool for PyCharm (File - Settings - Tools - Python Integrated Tools - Testing), you can then run tests from within PyCharm by right clicking the tests folder and selecting "Run pytest in tests".

Alternatively, from a terminal in the root folder of the project, you can also call 'python -m pytest tests' to run all the tests. PyCharm also provides a built-in terminal, which uses the configured virtual environment.

To run the tests for the database components, these are in the folder 'tests_db', so you can call 'python -m pytest tests_db' to run them from the command line.
